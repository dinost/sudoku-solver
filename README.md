# sudoku-solver
Hi there, I'm Serkan

I'm going to code a sudoku solver by implementing some AI algorithms myself and also by using different libraries.
Finally, I am going to compare their performance according to their time and space complexities.

My next project may be turning this into an Android app, who knows.
